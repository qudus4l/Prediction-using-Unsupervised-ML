# Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML

This is a simple machine learning project that predicts the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. It uses the elbow technique to determine the optimal number of clusters then visualizes the clusters.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.0 or later and the following libraries:

numpy pandas matplotlib sklearn

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a small dataset with two variables: the sepal length and width of three different species of iris flowers. The dataset has been provided in a CSV file iris.csv and contains 150 observations.

## Algorithm

The algorithm used in this project is the K-Means clustering algorithm. This algorithm is used to divide the dataset into K clusters, where K is a user-defined parameter. The algorithm works by iteratively updating the cluster centroids and assigning each data point to the nearest centroid. This process continues until the centroids no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
